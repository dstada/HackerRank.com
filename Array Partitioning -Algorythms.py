Array Partitioning

Divide a given array of numbers into two subarrays such that the absolute difference
between their sums is the smallest possible. For example, the array [2, 5, 4, 7, 15, 20]
can be divided into subarrays [15, 7, 4] and [20, 5, 2]. The difference between the sums
of those arrays is 1, and it is the smallest.

For example:
Input:
6
4, 15, 20, 2, 7, 5

Output:
[15, 7, 4]
[20, 5, 2]
1
(The sum of the first subarray is 26, the sum of the second subarray is 27, the difference is 1.)
